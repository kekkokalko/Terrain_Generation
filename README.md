# Terrain Generation

Terrain generation is the process of creating 3D landscapes in computer graphics. It is a technique used in various applications, including video games, virtual reality, and 3D modeling. Many different algorithms can be used to generate terrain. Still, they all share the same primary goal: to create a realistic and varied landscape that is visually appealing and challenging to explore.

**Procedural terrain generation algorithms** use mathematical formulas and algorithms to generate terrain automatically. These algorithms can create very realistic and varied terrain but can also be very complex and computationally expensive.

**Perlin noise** is a type of noise that is often used to create smooth, organic-looking landscapes. It is based on adding random values to a grid of points. The higher the value, the taller the terrain will be at that point.

**Fractals** are another common technique for generating terrain. Fractals are mathematical patterns that repeat themselves on different scales. This can be used to create landscapes with much detail and variation.

**Biomes** are regions of the world that share similar climate and vegetation. Terrain generation algorithms can create different biomes, such as forests, mountains, and deserts.

**Height maps** are a type of data that represents the height of a terrain. They can generate terrain using a mathematical function to convert the heightmap data into a 3D model.

Another standard procedural terrain generation algorithm is **cellular automata**, a system of cells that interact with each other according to a set of rules. Cellular automata can create more complex and realistic terrain than Perlin noise but can also be more computationally expensive.
