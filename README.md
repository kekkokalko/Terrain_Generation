# Terrain Generation

Terrain generation is the process of creating 3D landscapes in computer graphics. It is a technique used in various applications, including video games, virtual reality, and 3D modeling. Many different algorithms can be used to generate terrain. Still, they all share the same primary goal: to create a realistic and varied landscape that is visually appealing and challenging to explore.

Procedural terrain generation algorithms use mathematical formulas and algorithms to generate terrain automatically. These algorithms can create very realistic and varied terrain but can also be very complex and computationally expensive.
Perlin noise is a type of noise that is often used to create smooth, organic-looking landscapes. It is based on adding random values to a grid of points. The higher the value, the taller the terrain will be at that point.

Fractals are another common technique for generating terrain. Fractals are mathematical patterns that repeat themselves on different scales. This can be used to create landscapes with much detail and variation.
Biomes are regions of the world that share similar climate and vegetation. Terrain generation algorithms can create different biomes, such as forests, mountains, and deserts.
Height maps are a type of data that represents the height of a terrain. They can generate terrain using a mathematical function to convert the heightmap data into a 3D model.
Another standard procedural terrain generation algorithm is cellular automata, a system of cells that interact with each other according to a set of rules. Cellular automata can create more complex and realistic terrain than Perlin noise but can also be more computationally expensive.
